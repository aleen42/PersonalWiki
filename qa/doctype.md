## Something about <!DOCTYPE> [Back](./qa.md)

In the first line of a HTML document, we'll always see a special tag named, `<!DOCTYPE>`, before `<html>`. What it does is to to specify the type of this HTML, and tell browsers to read documents as a specific type.

For **HTML5**, we just specify like this: `<!DOCTYPE html>`. That's because **HTML5** does not belongs to **Standard Generalized Markup Language** (SGML) any more. That means that we don't need to use **Document Type Definition** (DTD) to include.
