## Contributions

Whatever comments, bugs, enhancements or policy problems you want to contribute to one of my projects, think twice before opening any issues or pull requests for me to make my life easier.

### 1. What to do before opening issues

At first, check out the list and find whether anyone else has opened the same issue with yours. If so, join and give out your words on those issues.

It is significant to add information about your platform and development environment after figuring out bugs, like the version of **OS**, **npm**, **Node**, etc. Screenshots are what I wish to see to grasp what you have met easily.

It is advised to wait for feedback before continuing to the next steps. Nevertheless, if the issue is clear and the fix is simple, feel free to fix it directly.

Make a detailed description of your issue. It should make me understand what you want to contribute to my projects.

### 2. Fixing issues

Fork the project in your account and create a branch with a standard naming convention:

**fix-#1-aleen42**

- **#1**: the issue number
- **aleen42**: the user name of your GitHub

Other conventions you should pay more attention to:

- My [configurations](https://github.com/aleen42/eslint-config-aleen42) of ESLint for JavaScript.
- My [conventions](./git/commit_message_convention/commit_message_convention.md) of committing messages.

### 3. Creating a pull request

After fixing the issue, open a pull request and reference the initially opened issue in the message you commit like **#1**. Write down an understandable description and title to state what your pull request has done.

### 4. Waiting for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, I'll review your code and keep in contact with you. Sometimes the procedure needs your patience to wait. Once contributions are approved, they should be merged as soon as possible.

### 5. RED TAG

**DO NOT** care too much about the number of contributions, and it's just noise all along.
