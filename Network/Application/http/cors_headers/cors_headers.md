## Headers around CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) [Back](../http.md)

It should be a large topic around CORS, and here just list some useful headers for solving CORS:

### 1. [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) (RESPONSE)

Indicates whether the response can be shared.

### 2. [`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods) (RESPONSE)

Specifies the methods allowed when accessing the resource in response to a [preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request).
