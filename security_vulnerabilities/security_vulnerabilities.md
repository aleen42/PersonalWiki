## Security Vulnerabilities [Back](../README.md)

This chapter mainly focuses on vulnerabilities in web applications, and to note some common cases around them with their solutions at the same time. To make the knowledge more reliable, I have referred to some well known security communities like [**OWASP**](https://www.owasp.org/), [**CVE**](https://cve.mitre.org/), etc.

In order to bring awareness to what threatens the integrity of websites, I would like to start a series of post on the **OWASP top 10 security risks** firstly:

1. [**Injection**](./injection/injection.md)
2. [**Broken Authentication**](./broken_authentication/broken_authentication.md)
3. [**Sensitive Data Exposure**](./sensitive_data_exposure/sensitive_data_exposure.md)
4. [**XML External Entities (XXE)**](./xxe/xxe.md)
5. **Broken Access control**
6. **Security misconfigurations**
7. **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
8. **Insecure Deserialization**
9. **Using Components with known vulnerabilities**
10. **Insufficient logging and monitoring**

Such a list should be updated every three to four years by **OWASP**, and the last released year is 2019.
