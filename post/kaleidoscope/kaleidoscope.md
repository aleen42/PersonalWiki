In Chinese, we will name kaleidoscopes as "萬花筒", which is a toy showing colorful shapes of thousands of flowers. Today, inspired by the project, [spring loaders](https://github.com/claudiocalautti/spring-loaders), I have tried myself to create a similar component with CSS and SVG, rather than Canvas. As the Figure 1 shown, that's my **kaleidoscope**.

#### How to create?

At the start, I have utilized the features of `div`, which is an HTML elements with a shape of rectangles.
