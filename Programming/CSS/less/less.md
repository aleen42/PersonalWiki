Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themeable and extendable.

During the process of learning it, you may need to compare Less with CSS in an [online editor](http://less2css.org/).
