## Asynchronous Programming [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

### 1. Introduction

In the computer science, I have always grasped that "Asynchronous" is a word for describing working states between threads. If the job of one thread does not affect another one, it indicates to be asynchronous. In this chapter, this word is mostly used for representing a skill of programming.

You may ask why we should use such a asynchronous programming skill. As JavaScript is almost run in a thread, and its executing blocks the UI thread at the same time, resulting in a really "disastrous" user experience, asynchronous programming allows developers to write code in a asynchronous way to improve performance of JavaScript code. With making great use of CPU resources to prevent from wasting calculation units, the effect is always impressive. For example, a long time task will occupy CPU without calculating anymore, like parsing a large data with JSON format, reading a file, or requesting something in a bad network status.

Certainly, asynchronous programming skill does not work in any cases. Before using such a skill to handle multitasking, be sure that tasks are non-preemptive (非優先級的), which also means that they're not related to each other. If one task relies on the result of another task, it's absolutely impossible to improve them by converting into in a asynchronous way. To explain it more apparently, I will take the following case as an example:

Assume that we have four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively, and then considering a simple task, in which we want to add them together.

The first way is as shown in the following snippet (**a common way**):

```js
/**
 * 1. calculating the adding of `a` and `b`
 * 2. calculating the adding of `c` and the result of step 1
 * 3. calculating the adding of `d` and the result of step 2
 */
var result = d + (c + (a + b));
```

And the second way is (**a asynchronous way**):

```js
/**
 * 1. calculating the adding of `a` and `b`,
 *    and the adding of `c` and `d` at the same time
 * 2. calculating the adding of two results of step 1
 */
var result = (d + c) + (a + b);
```

With considering two ways of calculating above, it's obvious that the second way is faster. Why? That's because each adding of the first way has relied on the result of previous step, while tasking of adding `c` and `d` is completely isolated from adding `a` and `b`. Therefore, the second way has saved some time by executing them in parallel.


> Note: asynchronous programming does not mean to use multiple threads.

### 2. Continuation-Passing Style (CPS)

#### 2.1 Introduction

Before discussing how to code in JavaScript with asynchronous programming skills, it is recommended to know a style in functional programming firstly, named **Continuation-Passing Style**, a.k.a **CPS**. In this style, control flows are passed explicitly, contrasted with direct style.

Also take the adding task as an example:

```js
/** direct style */
function add(prev, next) {
    return prev + next;
}

/** continuation-passing style */
function add(prev, next, callback) {
    callback(prev + next);
}
```

What is the difference with using continuation-passing style in JavaScript? There is no doubt that we don't need to wait for the return of calling adding function any more, which is especially efficient in the case when the adding task costs too much.

```js
/** calculation of result have to wait for the return of adding `a` and `b` */
result = c + add(a, b);

/** if using continuation-passing style, no waiting anymore */
add(a, b, function (sum) {
    result = c + sum;
};
```

#### 2.2 How to convert into CPS?

For any code with direct style, we can convert it into corresponding CPS mechanically, like applying a mathematical theory. In the following case, we will implement a task that loads the avatar image from a user. The main process is:

i. loading profile according to the user id

ii. loading avatar images according to the profile

```js
function loadProfile(id) {
    /** calculating ... */
    return profile;
}

function loadImage(url) {
    /** calculating ... */
    return image;
}

function loadAvatarImage(id) {
    var profile = loadProfile(id);
    return loadImage(profile.imageUrl);
}

var image = loadAvatarImage(1);
```

As we can see, this is a common way to do the task, which belongs to the direct style. To convert it into CPS, we should follow these several steps:

i. implement each function again with accepting a callback function as a last argument:

```js
function loadProfile(id, callback) {
    /** calculating ... */
    callback(profile);
}

function loadImage(url, callback) {
    /** calculating ... */
    callback(image);
}
```

ii. changing the process of loading by passing callback functions and pass the final result to the accepted callback function:

```js
function loadAvatarImage(id, callback) {
    loadProfile(id, function (profile) {
        loadImage(profile.imageUrl, function (image) {
            callback(image);
        });
    });
}
```

iii. call it by passing a callback function to handle the returned result:

```js
var image;
loadAvatarImage(1, function (img) {
    image = img;
});
```

Now then, since we have used callback function to handle the result, we don't need to wait for the assignment anymore, and we can just continue to let the code to do anything else.

##### **2.2.1 CPS converting for loops**

In additional, what if we want to use a loop flow to load avatar images for two users, the common way to implement it is to use direct style like this:

```js
var ids = [1, 2];
var images = [];
for (var i = 0, len = ids.length; i < len; i++) {
    loadAvatarImage(i, function (img) {
        images[i] = img;
    });
    
    console.log('done');
}
```

In the case of such a loop flow, we can also convert them into CPS by stepping as followed:

i. generate a recursive function for the loop flow:

```js
function loopToLoad(i, arr) {
    if (i < arr.length) {
        loopToLoad(i + 1, arr);
    } else {
        console.log('done');
    }

    loadAvatarImage(i, function (img) {
        images[i] = img;
    });
}
```

ii. creating forEach-like function by extracting `visitor`, and `done`:

```js
function forEachLoad(i, arr, visitor, done) {
    if (i < arr.length) {
        visitor(arr[i], i, function () {
            forEachLoad(i + 1, arr, next, done);
        });
    } else {
        done();
    }
}
```

iii. passing two types of callback functions:

```js
forEachLoad(0, ids, function (item, index, next) {
    loadAvatarImage(index, function (img) {
        images[index] = img;
    });

    next();
}, function () {
    console.log('done');
});
```

Wow, awesome for loops without worrying about the large size of an array!

##### **2.2.2 CPS converting for try-catch blocks**

Similarly, if we try to do some long time task within try-catch blocks, we can also use CPS to eliminate the waiting for the returned result.

```js
function div(dividend, divisor) {
    if (divisor === 0) {
        throw Error('Division by zero');
    }
    
    return dividend / divisor;
}

try {
    console.log(div(1, 0));
} catch (e) {
    console.log(`Catches: ${e}`);
}
```

Convert it into CPS:

i. complete the function again by extracting `success`, and `failure`:

```js
function div(dividend, divisor, success, failure) {
    if (divisor === 0) {
        failure(Error('Division by zero'));
    } else {
        success(dividend / divisor);
    }
}
```

ii. passing two callback functions:

```js
div(1, 0, function (result) {
    console.log(result);
}, function (e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

#### 2.3 Features

As we analyzed how to convert into CPS, there are two main features of CPS:

- **Inversion of control flows (控制流反轉)**
    
    It means that control flows has been inverted as it's passed explicitly. In another word, callback function has changed the original control flows in the process of stacks. For instance, we can control when to call callback functions within CPS, which means that the function caller has lost control of flows (_**In direct style, flows should go back to the callee.**_)

- **So-called "continuation"**

    In my opinion, "continuation" refers to the function which has eliminated return operations, and accept a callback function at the same time.
    
When it comes to the question whether we should use it, the answer is always that it depends.
    
Pros|Cons
:-------|:-------
Control of flows|Callback Hell
Without using `while/for`, `try/catch`, and even `return`|Exposed API, which is hard to maintain

### 3. Nested Structures

Assume that there is a case when we need to request some data, and use this data to request other data, and again and again, even with CPS, the nested structure should be absolutely confusing.

```js
function get(url, callback) {
    /** request some data */
    callback(data, error);
}

get('/foo', function (data1, error) {
    get(data1.url, function (data2, error) {
        get(data2.url, function (data3, error) {
            get(data3.url, function (data4, error) {
                /** nest again and again ... */
            });
        });
    });
});
```

So, how about using Promise supported by ES6?

```js
function get(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        /** request some data */
        resolve(data, error);
    });
}

get('/foo').then((data1, error) => {
    return get(data1.url);
}).then((data2, error) => {
    return get(data2.url);
}).then((data3, error) => {
    return get(data3.url);
}).catch(e) {
    console.log(e);
};
```

Or how about using Async/Await supported by ES7? (*Note: `await` statement only works for Promise object*)

```js
function get(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        /** request some data */
        resolve(data, error);
    });
}

(async function () {
    try {
        let data1 = await get('/foo');
        let data2 = await get(data1.url);
        let data3 = await get(data2.url);
        /** ... */
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
})();
```

Wow, both of them can eliminate the disgusting nested structure. Sometimes, any callback function can be converted into Async/Await style, by wrapping them with `Promise`, even if the function is not used for requesting data. For instance, I have made some callback function like `UI.confirm` before, which actually was an alerted box for asking for users' confirmation, with following snippet:

```js
UI.confirm = (message, callback) => {
    return new ConfirmBox({
        message,
        onConfirm: callback,
    });
};
```

This can leading us falling in the situation of disgusting nested structure easily, when requiring sequential confirmations:

```js
UI.confirm('first confirmation', () => {
    /** calling callback when first confirmation */
    /** ... */
    UI.confirm('second confirmation', () => {
        /** ... callback hell */
    });
});
```

As same as what I metioned above, Async/Await combined with `Promise` can easily resolve this problem:

```js
UI.confirm = message => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        new ConfirmBox({
            message,
            onConfirm: resolve.bind(null, true), /** always resolve without rejection */
        });
    });
};
```

Then, when meeting with sequential confirmations, don't worry, be happy!

```js
async () => {
    await UI.confirm('first confirmation');
    /** calling callback when first confirmation */
    /** ... */
    await UI.confirm('second confirmation');
    /** ... wow */
};
```

### 4. Coroutines

In the last section, we have already discussed how to use language syntax features supported by ES6 or ES7 to solve the problem of complicated nested structures, also called "Callback Hell" in JavaScript, when using CPS. If we div into the design of languages, we can grasped that it is actually related to a concept in the computer science, named **Coroutines (協程)**. So what are Coroutines? As described in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), they are components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution. In simple terms, we can execute code wherever we want, if there is an entry point. In my opinion, the callback function of CPS is such a point. However, it's not the same to some extent.

Coroutines can control where execution continues after they yield, but through accepting a callback function, we can only transfer the control back to the function caller. It means that the called function itself cannot decide where to continue to execute code, except calling callback function. Therefore, there is another concept to describe such a situation, named **Generators**, a.k.a semicoroutines (半協程).

With knowing what they are, why are there such concepts? That's because not all cases can be handled by using multiple threads. Assuming that there are so many tasks to do in a project, if we use one thread to handle one task only, it cost too much on switching contexts between threads. To take it in conclusion, Coroutines has allowed us to make use of CPU resources in only one thread without worrying about the cost of switching contexts.

To clear the differences among Processes, Threads, and Coroutines, I have imported a table from an project, named ["Learning Asynchronous Programming"](https://github.com/lwr/learning-async).

&nbsp;|Processes|Threads|Coroutines
:---|:--------|:----------|:-------------
overhead|Heavy|Normal Heavy|Few, which can be ignored
occupied resources|File Descriptor / Memory|Stack|Closure
run on|/|CPU Core / HT|Thread / Distributed Computers
cost of switching contexts|/|High|Low

pending|/|block / wakeup|suspend / resume
