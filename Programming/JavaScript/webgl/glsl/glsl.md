## GLSL [Back](./../webgl.md)

**GLSL**, a.k.a OpenGL Shading Language, is a high-level shading (著色) language based on the syntax of the C programming language. It was created to give developers more direct controls of the graphics pipeline without having to use ARB assembly language or hardware-specific languages.

GLSL shaders are not stand-alone applications, because they require an application that utilizes the OpenGL APIs, which is available on many different platforms (e.g., GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows).

In this document, I will note that how to use it in JavaScript.

### Utils

Before using this language, we should set up some utils to use before:

- [**webgl.js**](./webgl_js/webgl_js.md)
- [**gl-obj.js**](./gl_obj_js/gl_obj_js.md)

### Basics

I hope to learn GLSL via "[**\[O`Reilly\] GLSL Essentials**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/glsl-essentials/9781849698009/)", and make some notes here:

- [**The Graphics Rendering Pipeline**](./graphic_rendering_pipeline/graphic_rendering_pipeline.md)
