## WebVR Boilerplate [Back](./../VR.md)

[**WebVR Boilerplate**](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) is a open sourced project, which is based on three.js, for VR experiences that work well in both Google Cardboard and other VR headsets. It relies heavily on the [webvr-polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) to provide VR support if the WebVR API is not implemented in browsers.
