## Why React? [Back](./../react.md)

React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the **V** in **MVC**.

We built React to solve one problem: **building large applications with data that changes over time**.

### Simple

Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.
