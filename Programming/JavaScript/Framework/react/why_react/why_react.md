## Why React? [Back](./../react.md)

React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the **V** in **MVC**.

We built React to solve one problem: **building large applications with data that changes over time**.

### Simple

Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage all UI updates when your underlying data changes.

### Declarative(聲明)

When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the changed parts.

### Build Composable(可組合的) Components

React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React the only thing you do is build components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.

*In my way, the most important thing of using React is not its reusable feature, but the thought of divide and conquer(分治). Through React, you can build a big thing by dividing it into many small parts.*

### Give It Five Minutes

React challenges a lot of conventional wisdom, and at first glance some of the ideas may seem crazy. [Give it five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) while reading this guide; those crazy ideas have worked for building thousands of components both inside and outside of Facebook and Instagram.
