## Self-Closing Tag [Back](./../react.md)

In JSX, `<MyComponent />` alone is valid while `<MyComponent>` isn't. **All tags must be closed**, either with the self-closing format or with a corresponding closing tag (`</MyComponent>`).

> **Note:**

> Every React component can be self-closing: `<div />`. `<div></div>` is also an equivalent.
