All we know that Angular is a large JavaScript framework for building client-side application, and what it can actually help developers to do so? According to the official document, we can easily know that it can:

- extend HTML's syntax to build up components
- synchronize data from UI (view) through data bindings
- structure applications better and easier to test
- teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control
- helps with server-side communication, asynchronous callbacks with promises and deferred objects, and deep linking with hash-based urls ...

To take it in conclusion, it helps you to do almost everything.

Angular has developed with two versions, 1.x or 2. As they are around totally different, I have noted them respectively.

- [**AngularJS (1.x)**](./angular1/angular1.md)
- **Angular (2)**
