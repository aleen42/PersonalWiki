## High Performance [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

JavaScript's original goal was to improve the user experience of web pages.

With high-speed connections more available than ever, web pages started becoming heavier, embedding more information and multimedia. But the problem is: **JavaScript developers and web applications had evolved while the JavaScript engines had not**.

Even if, Chrome with a V8 engine and other later engines have improved that situation, some performance problems are hard to optimize. That's why we, developers, should always pay more attention to the optimization of JavaScript.
