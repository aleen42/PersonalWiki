## High Performance [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

JavaScript's original goal was to improve the user experience of web pages. 

With high-speed connections more available than ever, web pages started becoming heavier, embedding more information and multimedia. But the problem is: **JavaScript developers and web applications had evolved while the JavaScript engines had not**.

Even if, Chrome with V8 engine, and other later engines have improved that situation, some performance problems are hard to optimize.

That's why we, developers, should always pay more attention to optimizations of JavaScript.
