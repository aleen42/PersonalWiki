## Data Structure [Back](./../JavaScript.md)

As an experienced JavaScript developer moving to server-side programming, or in some cases when you want to implement some efficient complicated algorithms, you may have to implement some classic data structures in JavaScript.

This chapter mainly covers some of them for you:

- [**Arrays**](./array/array.md)
- [**Lists**](./list/list.md)
- [**Stacks**](./stack/stack.md)
- [**Queues**](./queue/queue.md)
- [**Linked Lists**](./linked_lists/linked_lists.md)
- [**Dictionaries**](./dictionary/dictionary.md)
- [**Hashing**](./hashing/hashing.md)
- [**Sets**](./sets/sets.md)
- [**Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**](./bt_bst/bt_bst.md)
- [**Graphs**](./graphs/graphs.md)

As a developer in the computer science, you may know the famous sentences which says that:

> Programs = Algorithms + Data Structures

What it means is that any programs we created should usually require some types of structures to manage data. For developers who has not accepted educations of the computer science in school, the only data structure they're familiar with is the *Array*. However, in some complicated cases when you facing a much more complex problem, you may have to know how to manage data with minimal overheads. That's why we need to learn in advanced for touching these data structures.
