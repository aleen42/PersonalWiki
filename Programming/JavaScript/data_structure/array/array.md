## Arrays [Back](./../data_structure.md)

The array is the most common data structure in computer programming.

### JavaScript Arrays Defined

The standard definition for an array is a linear collection of elements, where the elements can be accessed via indices, which are usually integers used to compute offsets. 

A JavaScript array is actually a specialized type of JavaScript object, with the indices being property names that can be integers used to represent offsets.

More details can be read at a [preceding post](./../../array/array.md).
