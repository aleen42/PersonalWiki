## Configuration [Back](./../laravel.md)

- All the configurations files have been put into **./config**.
- Web server should have the privileges to write **./storage** and **./bootstrap/cache**
- Laravel should set a **key** when installing with `key:generate`, which can keep data safe.
- `timezone` and `locale` can be set in the **./config/app.php**.

- 3 Components:
	- [**Cache**](./../cache/cache.md)
	- [**Database**](./../database/database.md)
