## Project Scope Management	[Back](./../projectManagement.md)

### 1. Definition

- **Scope** refers to all the work involved in creating the products of the project and the processes used to create them.
- A **deliverable** is a product produced as part of a project, such as hardware or software, planning documents, or meeting minutes(會議紀要)
- **Project scope management** includes the processes involved in defining and controlling what is or is not included in a project

### 2. Processes

1. Plan scope management
    - To use **expert judgment** to develop the scope management plan.
2. Collect requirements
    - To use **expert judgment** to develop the requirements management plan.
    - For some IT projects, it is helpful to divide requirements development into categories called elicitation(抽出), analysis, specification, and validation.
    - It is important to use an iterative(迭代的) approach to defining requirements since they are often unclear early in a project.
    - A **requirements traceability matrix (RTM, 需求追溯模型)** is a table that lists requirements, various attributes of each requirement, and the status of the requirements to ensure that all requirements are addressed. <img src="./rtm.png">
3. Define scope
    - **Project scope statements** should include at least a product scope description, product user acceptance criteria(用戶接受標準), and detailed information on all project deliverables.  <img src="./project_scope_statements.png">
4. Create WBS
    - A **Work breakdown structure(WBS)** is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines the total scope of the project.
    - **Decomposition(分解)** is subdividing(細分) project deliverables into smaller pieces.
    - A **work package(工作包)** is a task at the lowest level of the WBS.
    - The **scope baseline** includes the approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary.
5. Validate scope
    - **Scope validation** involves formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables. (Acceptance is often achieved by a customer inspection and then sign-off on key deliverables)
6. Control scope
    - Scope control involves controlling changes to the project scope.
    - **Variance** is the difference between planned and actual performance.

### 3. Approaches to develope WBS

- **Analog approach(類比法)**: Review WBSs of similar projects and tailor to(適應) your project.
- **Top-down approach(自上而下法)**: Start with the largest items of the project and break them down.
- **Bottom-up approach(自底向上法)**: Start with the specific tasks and roll them up.
- **Mind-mapping approach**: a technique that uses branches radiating out(分流) from a core idea to structure thoughts and ideas.

### 4. WBS Dictionary

- A **WBS dictionary** is a document that describes detailed information about each WBS item.
