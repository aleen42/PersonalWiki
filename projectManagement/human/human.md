<img src="./herzberg.png">

- **motivational factors**: achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth, which produce job satisfaction.
- **hygiene(健康) factors**: cause dissatisfaction if not present, but do not motivate workers to do more.  Examples include larger salaries, more supervision, and a more attractive work environment.

### 5. McClelland's Acquired-Needs Theory

- **Achievement(nAch)**: Achievers like challenging projects with achievable goals and lots of feedback.
- **Affiliation(nAff, 加入)**: People with high nAff desire harmonious relationships and need to feel accepted by others, so managers should try to create a cooperative work environment for them.
- **Power(nPow)**: People with a need for power desire either personal power (not good) or institutional(機構的) power (good for the organization).  Provide institutional power seekers with management opportunities.

### 6. McGregor's Theory X and Y

- **Theory X**: assumes workers dislike and avoid work, so managers must use coercion(脅迫), threats and various control schemes to get workers to meet objectives.
- **Theory Y**: assumes individuals consider work as natural as play or rest and enjoy the satisfaction of esteem(尊重) and self-actualization needs.
- **Theory Z**: introduced in 1981 by William Ouchi and is based on the Japanese approach to motivating workers, emphasizing trust, quality, collective decision making, and cultural values.
