## Information Technology Context	[Back](./../projectManagement.md)

### 1. Systems view

- Project managers need to use **systems thinking**: to take a holistic(整體的) view of carrying out projects within the context of the organization.
- a **systems approach** includes:
    - **Systems philosophy**
    - **Systems analysis**
    - **Systems management**

### 2. Three Sphere(領域) Model of Systems Management

<img src="./threeSphereModel.jpg">

- Organizations:
    - **Structural frame**: Roles and responsibilities, coordination and control.  (Organizational charts help describe the frame)
    - **Human resources frame**: Providing harmony between needs of the organization and needs of people.
    - **Political frame**: Coalitions(並集) composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Conflicts and power are key issues.
    - **symbolic frame**: Symbols and meanings related to events. Culture, language, traditions and image are all parts of this frame.

### 3. Organizational Structures

- Functional: **functional managers** -> **CEO**
- Project: **program managers** -> **CEO**
- Matrix: **personnel** -> **two or more bosses** (between functional and project structures)

### 4. Organiazational Culture

- a set of shared assumptions, values and behaviors that characterize the functioning of an organiaztion.
- characteristics of organizational culture (**bold** means it's more important):
    - **Member identify**
    - **Risk tolerance**
    - **Group emphasis**
    - **Reward criteria**
    - People focus
    - **Conflict tolerance**
    - **Unit integration**
    - Means-ends orientation(導向)
    - Control
    - **Open-systems focus**

### 5. Project Life Cycle

- a **project life cycle**: a collection of project phases. (from the projects' start point to the end point)
- phases of a traditional project life cycle.

- a **Systems Development Life Cycle(ADLC)** is a framework for describing the phases involved in developing and maintaining information systems. A system development project can follow:
    - **Predictive life cycle**: the scope of the project can be clearly articulated(清楚說明的) and the schedule and cost can be predicted.
        - **Waterfall Model**: has well-defined, linear stages of systems development and support.
        - **Spiral Model**: shows that software is developed using an iterative(迭代) or spiral(螺旋) approach rather than a linear approach.
        - **Incremental Build Model**: provides for progressive(漸進的) development of operational software.
        - **Prototyping(原型) Model**: used for developing prototypes to clarify user requirements.
        - **Rapid Application Development(RAD) Model**: used to produce systems quickly without sacrificing(犧牲) quality.
    - **Adaptive software development life cycle**: requirements cannot be clearly expressed, projects are mission driven and component based, using time-based cycles to meet target dates.
        - **Agile Development Model** 

### 6. Definitives

- **Globalization**: software has been completed by people all around the world in many companies.
- **Outsourcing(外包)**: an organization acquires goods and/or sources from an outside source.
    - **Offshoring(離岸外包)**: to describe outsourcing from another countries.
- **Virtual teams**: a group of individuals working across time and space using communiation technologies.

### 7. Scrum Framework

- **Scrum Framework** is a leading agile development method.

### 8. Q&A

> answer: <strong>*Project.*</strong>

- Which of the following is true of a matrix organizational structure?
    - In a matrix organizational structure, employees are organized into departments according to their skills, and there is little interaction between employees from different departments.
    - Project managers in matrix organizations have staff from only a single functional area working on their projects.
    - In a strong matrix organizational structure, the project manager controls the project budget and has moderate to high authority.
    - A matrix organizational structure is hierarchical, but instead of functional managers reporting to the CEO, program managers report to the CEO.

> answer: <strong>*In a strong matrix organizational structure, the project manager controls the project budget and has moderate to high authority.*</strong>

> answer: <strong>*Not group emphasis, but unit integration.*</strong>

- What refers to the degree to which the organization monitors and responds to changes in the external environment?

> answer: <strong>*Open-systems focus.*</strong>

- The first two traditional project phases (concept and development) focus on planning, and are often referred to as what?

> answer: <strong>*project feasibility.*</strong>

- In what phase, the project team creates a definitive or very accurate cost estimate, delivers the required work, and provides performance reports to stakeholders?

> answer: <strong>*implementation.*</strong>

- Which of the following is a disadvantage of virtual teams as compared to traditional teams?
    - Increased costs for office space and support
    - Limited flexibility in team working hours
    - Reduced opportunities for informal transfer of information

> answer: <strong>*Reduced opportunities for informal transfer of information.*</strong>
