## Project Quality Management	[Back](./../projectManagement.md)

- ISO defines **quality** as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements".
- Other experts define as:
    - **Conformance(一致) to requirements**
    - **Fitness to use**

### 1. Processes

1. Planning quality management
    - Scope Aspects of IT Projects:
        - Functionality
        - Features
        - System outputs
        - Performance
        - Reliability
        - Maintainability
    - Project managers are ultimately(最終) responsible for quality management on their projects.
2. Performing quality assurance
    - **Quality assurance** includes all the activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standards for a project.
    - **Benchmarking(基準)** generates ideas for quality improvements by comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to those of other projects or products within or outside the performing organization.
    - A **quality audit** is a structured review of specific quality management activities that help identify lessons learned that could improve performance on current or future projects.
3. Performing quality control

### 2. Cause-and-Effect Diagrams

- **Cause-and-effect diagrams** trace complaints about quality problems back to the responsible production operations. (Also called **fishbone diagrams** or **Ishikawa diagrams**)

### 3. Quality Control Charts

- A **control chart** is a graphic display of data that illustrates the results of a process over time.
- The main purpose of using control charts is to prevent defects(缺陷) rather than to detect or reject them.

### 4. Checksheet

- A **checksheet** is used to collect and analyze data. (Also called **tally sheet** or **checklist**)

<img src="./checksheet.png">

### 5. Scatter Diagrams

- A **scatter diagram** helps to show if there is a relationship between two variables.
- The closer data points are to a diagonal line(对角线), the more closely the two variables are related.

### 6. Histograms

- A **histogram** is a bar graph of a distribution of variables.
- Each bar represents an attribute or characteristic of a problem or situation, and the height of the bar represents its frequency.

### 7. Pareto Charts

- A **Pareto chart** is a histogram that can help you identify and prioritize problem areas.
- **Pareto analysis** is also called the 80-20 rule, meaning that 80 percent of problems are often due to 20 percent of the causes.

### 8. Flowcharts

- **Flowcharts** are graphic displays of the logic and flow of processes that help you analyze how problems occur and how processes can be improved.

### 9. Run Charts

- A **run chart** displays the history and pattern of variation of a process over time.

### 10. Testing

<img src="./testing.jpg">

- **Unit testing** tests each individual component (often a program) to ensure it is as defect-free as possible.
- **Integration testing** occurs between unit and system testing to test functionally grouped components.
- **System testing** tests the entire system as one entity.
- **User acceptance testing** is an independent test performed by end users prior to accepting the delivered system.


- Watts S. Humphrey, a renowned expert on software quality, defines a **software defect** as anything that must be changed before delivery of the program.

### 11. Maturity Models

- **Maturity models** are frameworks for helping organizations improve their processes and systems.
    - The **Software Quality Function Deployment Model** focuses on defining user requirements and planning software projects.
    - The Software Engineering Institute's **Capability Maturity Model Integration** is a process improvement approach that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes.

### 12. CMMI Levels

- **CMMI Levels** is a formal standard to identify the quality of a software companies.
    - 0: Incomplete
    - 1: Performed
    - 2: Maged
    - 3: Defined (**government projects baseline**)
    - 4: Quantitatively Managed
    - 5: Optimizing
